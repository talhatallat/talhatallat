# 10-6. Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a TypeError. 
#   Write a program that prompts for two numbers. Add them together and print the result. 
#   Catch the TypeError if either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a number.

        print("numbers were not provided!")
else:
    print(cal)

# 10-7. Addition Calculator: Wrap your code from Exercise 10-6 in a while loop so the user can continue entering numbers even if they make a mistake and enter text instead of a number.

# Wrap your code in a try-except block to catch the FileNotFound error, and print a friendly message if a file is missing.
