# Python Crash Course

## Expect to Learn?

* Learn about different kinds of data and the ways you can store data in lists and dictionaries within your programs.
* Learn to build collections of data and work through those collections in efficient ways.
* Learn to use while and if loops to test for certain conditions are true.
* A technique that greatly helps to automate processes.
* Learn to accept input from users to make your programs interactive and to keep your programs running as long as the user is active.
* Explore how to write functions to make parts of a program reusable, to write blocks of code that perform certain actions once, which you can then use as many times.
* Learn to write programs that handle common errors gracefully.
* Learning how to write tests for a code to develop programs without worrying about introducing bugs.
* AND MUCH MORE


### Python Keywords

Each of the following keywords has a specific meaning, and you’ll see an error if you try to use them as a variable name.
False    class      finally    is         returnNone     continue   for        lambda     tryTrue     def        from       nonlocal   whileand      del        global     not        withas       elif       if         or         yieldassert   else       import     passbreak    except     in         raise

### Python Built-in Functions
You won’t get an error if you use one of the following readily available built-in functions as a variable name, but you’ll override the behavior of that function:


abs()          
divmod()      
input()         
open()      
staticmethod()
all()          
enumerate()
int()           
ord()       
str()
any()          
eval()        
isinstance()    pow()       sum()basestring()   execfile()    issubclass()    print()     super()  bin()          file()        iter()          property()  tuple()bool()         filter()      len()           range()     type() bytearray()    float()       list()          raw_input() unichr()callable()     format()      locals()        reduce()    unicode()chr()          frozenset()   long()          reload()    vars() classmethod()  getattr()     map()           repr()      xrange()cmp()          globals()     max()           reversed()  zip()compile()      hasattr()     memoryview()    round()     __import__()complex()      hash()        min()           set()       apply()delattr()      help()        next()          setattr()   buffer()dict()         hex()         object()        slice()     coerce()dir()          id()          oct()           sorted()    intern()

## Summary 

### Chapter 1 - Getting Started
  * learned a bit about Python in general, and installed Python to windows system.
  * learned how to Run Python in Visual Studio Code on Windows.
  * learned to run snippets of Python code in a terminal session.
  * Ran actual program, hello_world.py and learned a bit about troubleshooting.

### Chapter 2 - VARIABLES AND SIMPLE DATA TYPES
 * learned to work with variables and to use descriptive variable names and how to resolve name errors and syntax errors when they arise.
 * learned what strings are and how to display strings using lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.
 * learned to strip unneeded whitespace from different parts of a string.
 * learned to write explanatory comments to make your code easier for you and others to read.

### Chapter 3 - LISTS

* learned what lists are and how to work with the individual items in a list. 
* learned how to define a list and how to add and remove elements. 
* learned to sort lists permanently and temporarily for display purposes. 
* learned how to find the length of a list and how to avoid index errors when working with lists.


### Chapter 4 - WORKING WITH LISTS

* learned how to work efficiently with the elements in a list. 
* learned how to work through a list using a for loop, how Python uses indentation to structure a program, and how to avoid some common indentation errors. 
* learned to make simple numerical lists, as well as a few operations which can be perform on numerical lists. 
* learned how to slice a list to work with a subset of items and how to copy lists properly using a slice. 
* learned about tuples, which provide a degree of protection to a set of values that shouldn’t change, and how to style your increasingly complex code to make it easy to read.

### Chapter 5 - IF STATEMENTS

* learned how to write conditional tests, which always evaluate to True or False. 
* learned to write simple if statements, if-else chains, and if-elif-else chains. Useed these structures to identify particular conditions needed to test and to know when those conditions have been met in your programs. 
* learned to handle certain items in a list differently than all other items while continuing to utilize the efficiency of a for loop. 
* revisited Python’s style recommendations to ensure that your increasingly complex programs are still relatively easy to read and understand.

### Chapter 6 - DICTIONARIES

* learned how to define a dictionary and how to work with the information stored in a dictionary. 
* learned how to access and modify individual elements in a dictionary, and how to loop through all of the information in a dictionary. 
* learned to loop through a dictionary’s key-value pairs, its keys, and its values. 
* learned how to nest multiple dictionaries in a list, nest lists in a dictionary, and nest a dictionary inside a dictionary.

### Chapter 7 - USER INPUT AND WHILE LOOPS

* learned how to use input() to allow users to provide their own information in the programs. 
* learned to work with both text and numerical input and how to use while loops to make programs run as long as users want them to. 
* learned several ways to control the flow of a while loop by setting an active flag, using the break statement, and using the continue statement. 
* learned how to use a while loop to move items from one list to another and how to remove all instances of a value from a list. 
* learned how while loops can be used with dictionaries.
