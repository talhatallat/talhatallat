## 7-1. Rental Car: 
Write a program that asks the user what kind of rental car they would like. Print a message about that car, such as “Let me see if I can find you a Subaru.”
## 7-2. Restaurant Seating: 
Write a program that asks the user how many people are in their dinner group. If the answer is more than eight, print a message saying they’ll have to wait for a table. Otherwise, report that their table is ready.
## 7-3. Multiples of Ten: 
Ask the user for a number, and then report whether the number is a multiple of 10 or not.

## 7-4. Pizza Toppings: 
Write a loop that prompts the user to enter a series of pizza toppings until they enter a 'quit' value. As they enter each topping, print a message saying you’ll add that topping to their pizza.
## 7-5. Movie Tickets: 
A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person’s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket.
## 7-6. Three Exits: 
Write different versions of either Exercise 7-4 or Exercise 7-5 that do each of the following at least once:
• Use a conditional test in the while statement to stop the loop.
• Use an active variable to control how long the loop runs.
• Use a break statement to exit the loop when the user enters a 'quit' value.
## 7-7. Infinity: 
Write a loop that never ends, and run it. (To end the loop, press CTRL-C or close the window displaying the output.)
