# 8-12. Sandwiches: Write a function that accepts a list of items a person wants on a sandwich. The function should have one parameter that collects as many items as the function call provides, and it should print a summary of the sandwich that is being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different number of arguments each time.

# 8-13. User Profile: Start with a copy of user_profile.py from page 153. Build a profile of yourself by calling build_profile(), using your first and last names and three other key-value pairs that describe you.

# 8-14. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a call like this one:
#car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)
#Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
