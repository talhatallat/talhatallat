## 5-3: Alien Colors #1
Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
* Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
* Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
## 5-4: Alien Colors #2
Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 5-3, and write an if-else chain.
* If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
* If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
* Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.
## 5-5: Alien Colors #3
Turn if-else chain from Exercise 5-4 into an if-elif-else chain.
* If the alien is green, print a message that the player earned 5 points.
* If the alien is yellow, print a message that the player earned 10 points.
* If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.
* Write three versions of this program, making sure each message is printed for the appropriate color alien.
## 5-6: Stages of Life
Write an if-elif-else chain that determines a person’s stage of life. Set a value for the variable age, and then:
* If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.
* If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.
* If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a kid.
* If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person is a teenager.
## 5-7: Favorite Fruit
Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.
* Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
* Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!

## 5-8. Hello Admin: in progress....
Make a list of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the list, and print a greeting to each user:
* If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?
* Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.
