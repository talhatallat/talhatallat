* Creating and Using a Class
* Making an Instance from a Class
* Accessing Attributes
* Creating Multiple Instances
## 9-1. Restaurant: 
Make a class called Restaurant. The __init__() method for Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type. Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indicating that the restaurant is open.

Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attributes individually, and then call both methods.

## 9-2. Three Restaurants: 
Start with your class from Exercise 9-1. Create three different instances from the class, and call describe_restaurant() for each instance.

## 9-3. Users: 
Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints a personalized greeting to the user.
  
Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods for each user.
